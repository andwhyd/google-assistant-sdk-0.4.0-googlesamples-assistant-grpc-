# google-assistant-sdk-0.4.0-googlesamples-assistant-grpc-
Project with Google and MVRT to control a robotic arm to play various games using google assistant.
This respository was used to test smaller changes and back when I was less familiar with using github. Realistically this should have been a seperate branch rather than a new repository.

The completed project can be found here: [https://github.com/mvrt-115/google_arm_project](https://github.com/mvrt-115/google_arm_project)
Project was presented to Google in 2018. No additional work has been done since then.
